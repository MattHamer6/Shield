# Shield Homes
## Website currently not live

A bespoke WordPress theme built to be as easy to use as possible for the client with the help of a page builder, and multiple unique blocks. 

## Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* SCSS/SASS
* JavaScript/jQuery
* PHP
* WordPress

## Notes:
This is my most recent build, and is still in-progress so not currently live. I used this build to experiment with a new JS library I found - anime.js, which allows you to create smooth transitions on elements when they are in the users viewport.
